State Police System


Nowadays, we are in the digitalization era. Everything is being processing online. It is faster, better and safer. Unfortunately for Albanian institutions which require a lot of paper work, we are still behind in this process. The whole process of assigning tasks, searching information, keep tracking of user locations, checking reports and sending reports is done manually in one of the main institutions of our country, such as the State Police. Here comes into play the State Police System, the software we are providing that aims to ease the State Police daily tasks. Since the State Police is a very important institution, this software will try to digitalize every step of the police work and implement some new features that will come to help.
State Police System will be an internal system that will try to ease the Police hard-work.

It will be designed by 2 approaches. 
The first one will be the client - side. It will consist just a simple web page with several services.
The second one will be the most important one. The features will be implemented to ease the police paper work and also improve the communication between police precincts. It will have several organizational structures.
